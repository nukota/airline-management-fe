> The rapid growth of the airline tourism industry has significantly increased the need for efficient airline flight management and seamless interaction between airlines and customers.  
> Traditional methods that rely heavily on paperwork and manual processes for managing flights and selling tickets consume substantial human resources and are prone to errors.  
> 
> This project proposes a web-based airline ticket management system that enables both customers and airport staff to view flight information, book, and purchase tickets in a modern, intuitive, and efficient manner—anytime, anywhere, with an internet-connected device.
